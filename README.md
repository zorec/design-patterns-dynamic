## Examples of design Patterns in dynamic languages

Design patterns or elements of reusable object-oriented programming as they are defined in Go4 book are ways to solve common problems in a software design. It is known that design patterns are significantly simpler in dynamic languages:
> "16 of 23 patterns have qualitatively simpler implementation in Lisp or Dylan than in C++ for at least some uses of each pattern." Peter Norvig

This project aims to demonstrate these design patterns on specific examples in a contemporary dynamic language e.g. Ruby.
